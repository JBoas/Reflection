# End of Second Week
## 9/15/2017
This week we covered a lot about Python 3. First we started by learning the command print which just prints whatever text you put in (""). We then learned how to use variables and assign them. We went over how to add some input as a variable. I read some articles on the print function and string manipulation. I learned how to write out a varible in between a print function. We ended the week by learning how to add numbers with float and int. Float makes the number have decimals and int is just whole numbers.

# End of Third Week
## 9/22/2017
We covered a lot about variables and integers in Python3. We went over how to do code circumference of a circle and how to add an integer like this i = i + 1. We learned about how to create a list and use them. They are represented by [] and how to pull certain things out of the list ex, print(gpas[3]) would pull out the 4th gpa in the list of gpas. How to add strings to a pre existing list using   .append(input("")). We covered how to split a sentence up using .split() and to insert characters between words. Ex, blank = "character between words here".join(message). I learned how to make a madlib by replacing words in a story with story = story.replace("word here",name of variable that new word is assigned to). I then began my homework and have completed problems 1 to 4 and working on problem 5.

# End of Fourth Week
## 9/29/2017
We had a couple of work days at the beginning of the week which I spent working on problem 5. I had to code the addition part of a calculator using .split to split the additon a the the + symbol. I then added int(numbers[0]) and int(numbers[1]). This would add the two numbers together with just one line of input from the user. Later in the week we started conditionals with if, and, or, and else statements. The if statement was basically if blank is true then activate next line of code. The and statement makes the if statement more complicated by adding more to it to make it true. The or statement made an if statement have more than one possible way to make it true for example(if(password == "Dog" or "Cat"):. The else statement made it so if nothing made the if statement true the program had something to go to. For example if(password == "Dog" or "Cat"): ended up not being true you could put the else statement after to put "Wrong Password".

# End of Fifth Week
## 10/10/2017
This week was mainly working on a coverter for time. The code would convert 12 hour to 24 hour and 24hour to 12 hour. All you had to do is  enter in the time. Some of the commands I used were: if,or,and,is,not,list(), and isnumeric(). The only new command was isnumeric(), which detects if the string can be converted to a proper integer or not. I used it as a filter for the 24 hour time section of my code. The problem I ran into was my code trying to convert letters into numbers. I also used <,>,<=,>=, in my code to act as filters. My problem was solved when I learned the command isnumeric().
