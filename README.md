# End of Second Week
## 9/15/2017
This week we covered a lot about Python 3. First we started by learning the command print which just prints whatever text you put in (""). We then learned how to use variables and assign them. We went over how to add some input as a variable. I read some articles on the print function and string manipulation. I learned how to write out a varible in between a print function. We ended the week by learning how to add numbers with float and int. Float makes the number have decimals and int is just whole numbers.
