# End of Second Week
## 9/15/2017
This week we covered a lot about Python 3. First we started by learning the command print which just prints whatever text you put in (""). We then learned how to use variables and assign them. We went over how to add some input as a variable. I read some articles on the print function and string manipulation. I learned how to write out a varible in between a print function. We ended the week by learning how to add numbers with float and int. Float makes the number have decimals and int is just whole numbers.

# End of Third Week
## 9/22/2017
We covered a lot about variables and integers in Python3. We went over how to do code circumference of a circle and how to add an integer like this i = i + 1. We learned about how to create a list and use them. They are represented by [] and how to pull certain things out of the list ex, print(gpas[3]) would pull out the 4th gpa in the list of gpas. How to add strings to a pre existing list using   .append(input("")). We covered how to split a sentence up using .split() and to insert characters between words. Ex, blank = "character between words here".join(message). I learned how to make a madlib by replacing words in a story with story = story.replace("word here",name of variable that new word is assigned to). I then began my homework and have completed problems 1 to 4 and working on problem 5.
